## Filtering Columns and Rows

When using dplyr, yu can filter columns and rows by using select and filter.
Let's look at an example using Lahman data base.
We first have to load the Lahman and dplyr packages.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

Now, Suppose we would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 New York Yankees, We could run the following Code :

```{r}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=='NYA' & yearID==1927)
```
